### About The Project

**Ecoleta** is a Web and Mobile application to help people find collection points for recycling.

This application was built on the **Booster Track** of the **Next Level Week** distributed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). The idea of creating an application focused on the environment arose from the coincidence of date from the course and date from the **environment week**.
